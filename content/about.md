Welcome to my website.

I'm a software developer living in the Northeastern United States.

I live with my fianc√©e, Megan, and our two cats, Bernard and Stella.

Sometimes I'll post on this site, what I'm thinking about, or what I'm working on.

It will never be the viewpoints of my employer, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

You can email me at [billdaws.marvelous519@passmail.net](mailto:billdaws.marvelous519@passmail.net).

(This is an alias email -- posting my real one could expose me to an unstoppable deluge of spam.)
